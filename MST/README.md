# MST Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of MST in C++, such as Kruskal algorithm and Prim's algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

## Features
 **Prim's Algorithm**: Builds the Minimum Spanning Tree by iteratively adding the smallest edge connecting the growing MST to an unvisited vertex.

### Prim's Algorithm

```bash
cd MST
g++ -std=c++17 prim.cpp -o prim
./prim
```

## Future Improvements

- Add Kruskal's algorithm for MST.
- Implement Bellman-Ford.
- Add priority - queue implementation for Prim's algorithm.
- Create a CLI interface for easier interaction.
