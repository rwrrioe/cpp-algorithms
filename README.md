C++ Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of common algorithms in C++ for learning and practice.  
Each algorithm has its own folder with source code and a README explaining usage.

Algorithms

- DFS (DFS/) — Depth-First Search
- BFS (BFS/) — Breadth-First Search
- Dijkstra (Dijkstra/) — Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

- Each algorithm folder contains source code and a README with explanation and example usage.

Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/cpp-algorithms.git

2. Open the folder in Visual Studio or any C++ IDE.  
3. Navigate to an algorithm folder (e.g., DFS/) and build/run the code.

Contributing

- Feel free to add new algorithms in separate folders.  
- Keep each algorithm self-contained with its own README.  
- Use .gitignore to avoid committing binaries or IDE-specific files.
